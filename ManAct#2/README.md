a) What are packages in your implementation? What data structure do you use to transmit data and meta-data?
- Packages in our implementation are strings. The datastructure we use to transmit data and meta-data is ______.

b) Does your implementation use threads or processes? Why is it not realistic to use threads?
- Our implementation uses threads to simulate how the protocol would work. It is not realistic to actually use threads since the protocol should run across a network.

c) In case the network changes the order in which messages are delivered, how would you handle message re-ordering?

d) In case messages can be delayed or lost, how does your implementation handle message loss?

e) Why is the 3-way handshake important?
